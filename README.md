All pull requests are welcome!
To set up the project, [register](https://github.com/settings/developers) your OAuth application and paste your key and secret in the app.config file in the root of the project

#Things to be done
CodeHub aims to do all those things that the GitHub Desktop app doesn't do. Our goal is to make an app for UWP which lets you keep up with the open source world on the go.
I think these features are needed in CodeHub:
* Fork repos
* Trending developers
* Syntax highlighting for code
* Search code, issues
